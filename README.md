Model_Building.ipynb is where we build a model to predict the class of each customer, which can be used to find the classes of customers in future. I have added some ideas there.

The customer_segmentation.ipynb file tries to do segmentation of customers in the data. It is very much similar to the order segmentation notebook. Though it doesn't have a lot of explanation you should be able to understand it after going through the former notebook. At the end of this notebook it gets real interesting.

The order_segmentation_0.0.ipynb file contains detailed notes and explanation of doing segmentation of orders in the data. I have also added my ideas in it. It's a clean walk through. I suggest to start there.

I have added another file which is a bunch of functions that could help in visualizing and finding meaningful clusters within the data. These functions provide various ways to analyse for clusters in the data.
